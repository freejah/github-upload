                It is part of the eighth generation of the Pokémon video game series and serves as a prequel to Pokémon Diamond and Pearl (2006), their enhanced version Pokémon Platinum (2008), and their remakes Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl (2021). 
                The game was first announced as part of the Pokémon 25th Anniversary event in February 2021, and was released worldwide on 28 January 2022.

                The <strong>San Francisco 49ers</strong> finished the season 10-7 and closed the regular season as one of the hottest teams in the NFL. 
                They rode that hot streak into the playoffs and made it to the NFC Championship game. 
                However, the team came up short against their division rival, the Los Angeles Rams, in a 20-17 game that they once led by double digits. 
                This was a season in which wide receiver <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3126486/deebo-samuel"><em>Deebo Samuel</em></a> emerged as one of the best all-around weapons in the NFL and the team reached its second NFC championship in the last three seasons. 
                There are plenty of questions surrounding this franchise this offseason, as they attempt to remain a contender in the NFC for years to come.
